# Tiny Sovereign Nations

## Notebook

To run this notebook, the following libraries are needed:
1. jupyter
2. pandas
3. geopands
4. matplotlib

The notebook takes and reads data from geojson.xyz before making a copy for offline analysis.<br>
It goes on to explain various ways of exploring and manipulating the data before settling on a final version ready for mapping use.

## Map

The index.html takes the exported data from the notebook and plots it on map.<br>
The basemap used is Voyager from CARTO and the webpage takes on a Bootstrap framework.
